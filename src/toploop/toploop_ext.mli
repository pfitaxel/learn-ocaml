include module type of Toploop_results

(** Parse and typecheck a given source code.

    @param setenv should the resulting environment replace the current
                  environment ?

    @return [Ok ()] in case of success and [Error err]
            where [err] contains the error message otherwise.

(** Execute a given source code. The evaluation stops after the
    first toplevel phrase (as terminated by ";;") that fails to
    parse/typecheck/compile or for which the evaluation raises an
    uncaught exception.

    @param ppf_code a formatter were the source code will be printed
           before its execution. The printing might be interleaved
           with call to "pp_answer" when a line finishes by ";;".

    @param ppf_answer a formatter were the compiler outputs will be
           printed.

    @param print_outcome should the toplevel print the computed
           values and their types ?

    @return [Error err] when parsing or typechecking failed, where
            [err] contains the error message. It returns [Ok true]
            when the code evaluation finished without uncaught
            exception, and [Ok false] otherwise. In the last case,
            the exception has been pretty-printed in [ppf_answer].
